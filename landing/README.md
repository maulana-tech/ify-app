# Landing page (standalone deploy to Vercel)

This folder builds the public marketing landing page (`LandingPage.tsx`) as a **separate static app** so it can be deployed to **Vercel** independently of the main app (which runs on Railway as a Node/Docker service).

## How it works

- Entry: `landing/src/main.tsx` renders `orchestrator/src/client/pages/LandingPage.tsx` via the `@landing` alias.
- Styles: Tailwind v4 (`@tailwindcss/vite`) with `landing/src/index.css`.
- Assets: reuses `orchestrator/public` as `publicDir`, so screenshots resolve at `/landing/*.png`.
- CTA links: `AppLink` in `LandingPage.tsx` uses `VITE_APP_URL` when set → CTAs open the real app (Railway). Unset in the monolith build → keeps `react-router` `Link`.

## Local dev

```bash
npm install          # from the repo root - landing is an npm workspace
cd landing
npm run dev
```

`landing` must be installed from the repo root: it imports a file from
`orchestrator/src`, so that tree needs its dependencies too. Its React,
router, Vite and TypeScript versions are pinned to match `orchestrator/`
so the bundle ends up with a single copy of each.

## Deploy to Vercel

1. Import repo → **Root Directory: `landing`**, with "Include files outside root directory" enabled.
2. Framework preset: **Vite**. `vercel.json` installs from the repo root (`cd .. && npm install`).
3. Env: `VITE_APP_URL` = your app origin, e.g. `https://career-boardsbamboohr-production-5d85.up.railway.app`.
4. Deploy.

`vercel.json` sets the SPA rewrite (`/(.*)` → `/`). Set `VITE_APP_URL` directly in Vercel's Environment Variables settings.

## Notes

- The landing page is self-contained: it only needs `lenis` + `react-router-dom`.
- Keep screenshots in `orchestrator/public/landing/`.
- If you change `VITE_APP_URL`, redeploy the landing on Vercel (env vars are baked at build time).

## Sync

`landing` has no separate copy of the page — it imports the shared component from the orchestrator client tree, so it stays in sync automatically.
